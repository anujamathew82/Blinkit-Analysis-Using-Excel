# Introduction: BlinkIT Grocery Sales Analysis (2011-2022)

This report presents a sales analysis for BlinkIT Grocery, examining performance based on data from outlets established between 2011 and 2022.

The primary objective is to uncover sales patterns and key performance drivers by evaluating four main KPIs: **Total Sales**, **Average Sales**, **Total Items Sold**, and **Average Customer Rating**.

The analysis segments performance across several critical dimensions to identify key trends:

* **Product:** Sales by Item Fat Content (Low Fat vs. Regular).
* **Store Location:** Sales by Outlet Location Type (Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3).
* **Store Attributes:** Sales by Outlet Size (Small, Medium, High).
* **Store Vintage:** Sales performance based on the Outlet Establishment Year.

These insights are intended to highlight the key factors influencing revenue and to help understand the performance of different store and product segments.

# Data Cleaning

To prepare the dataset for analysis, the following cleaning and transformation steps were executed:

### Standardized Item Fat Content:
Corrected inconsistent entries in the Item Fat Content column. Values like 'low fat' and 'LF' were mapped to 'Low Fat', and 'reg' was mapped to 'Regular' to ensure data uniformity.

### Added SNO Column:
A new column named SNO (Serial Number) was introduced to provide a unique identifier for each item record, facilitating accurate counts and indexing.
